# Shrodinger

Code developped in colaboration with Lou-Anne Veyrat.

Language : Python

We have study the propagation of an electron described by a gaussian wave packet. We have choosed to use atomic unity so the reduced Planck constant and the mass of the electon are equal to one (but those parameters can be changed inside the Param() function).

Possible improvement :

-The normalization is to simple. There are obviously other better way to do it.
